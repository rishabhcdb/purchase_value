# Purchase Value Prediction Project

# Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the purchase value of users by leveraging machine learning algorithms on an online shopping dataset that captures a multitude of features. The dataset comprises user traffic sources, user counts, purchaser counts, and conversion rates, which are used to build predictive models estimating the purchase amount. The goal is to identify key features and train effective models to predict purchase behavior accurately.

# Dataset Description
The dataset includes various attributes related to user behavior, such as:

Traffic Source Medium (e.g., organic, referral, cpc, etc.)

Total Users from each medium

Number of Purchasers in each group

Conversion Rate per traffic source

These features help understand purchasing trends and are used for model training.

# Key Steps in the Notebook
Data Exploration: Initial analysis of user data, conversion rates, and traffic sources.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (if applicable), and preparing features for model input.

Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features that influence purchase value prediction.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Implementation of various machine learning algorithms.

Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics.

Prediction: Using the trained models to predict purchase values.

# Technologies Used
Python
Popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization.

# How to Use
Load the dataset.

Run the preprocessing steps.

Train the models using the prepared data.

Evaluate and compare model performances.

Use the best-performing model for purchase value prediction on new data.

# Project Outcome
The project aims to provide actionable insights into user purchase behaviors and improve sales forecasting through reliable prediction models.
